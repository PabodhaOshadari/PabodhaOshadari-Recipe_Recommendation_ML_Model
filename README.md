# PabodhaOshadari-Recipe_Recommendation_ML_Model
This project implements an AI-powered recipe suggestion system that recommends healthy recipes based on nutritional constraints and ingredient filters. Using the Food.com Recipes &amp; Reviews dataset from Kaggle, the system applies Nearest Neighbors (cosine similarity) to suggest recipes that fit user-defined dietary preferences.
